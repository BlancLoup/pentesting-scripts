This script can automatically retrieve JSON Web Tokens (JWT) from an Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) server. These tokens subsequently can be automatically copied to the clipboard, or used in other tools. Very handy for automating retrieval of short-lived tokens.

The script can also 'brute-force' API endpoints, when passed a list of possible URLs. This might come in handy if you want to 'prefeed' the API endpoints that need authentication to your favourite proxy tool, e.g. Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP. By default it does a GET, POST, PUT and DELETE, with static values.

Feedback is always welcome - enjoy !
